# Flag Watcher

A simple tool that checks if a specified flag exists.

The way it works is by checking for existing flags in the [FVariable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Client-Tracker/roblox/FVariables.txt).

Flag Watcher is supported only on Windows.

## Installation

Download the [latest version of Flag Watcher](https://github.com/validchoice/flag-watcher/releases/latest) and run the installer.

The installer will guide you through the setup process. That's it!

If your antivirus software blocks the installer, it's because it's an unknown program. To proceed, click "More info" and then "Run anyway."

If you have concerns about the program, you can review the [source](https://github.com/validchoice/flag-watcher/blob/main/src/).

Once installed, Flag Watcher will appear in your Start menu. To check a flag, click on the Windows icon, type "Flag Watcher," and it will appear!

## Purpose

I'm lazy to open Discord and use bloxstrap test thing.
