# Flag Watcher

A simple tool that checks if a specified flag exists.

Flag Watcher is supported only on Windows.

## Installation

Download the [latest version of Flag Watcher](https://github.com/validchoice/flag-watcher/releases/latest) and run the installer.

The installer will guide you through the setup process. That's it!

If your antivirus software blocks the installer, it's because it's an unknown program. To proceed, click "More info" and then "Run anyway."

If you have concerns about the program, you can review the [source code](https://github.com/validchoice/flag-watcher/src/main.rs).

Once installed, Flag Watcher will appear in your Start menu. To check a flag, click on the Windows icon, type "Flag Watcher," and it will be there!

## Purpose

I created this tool to avoid the hassle of opening Discord, joining a server, and using the Bloxstrap bot. If you find yourself in the same situation, this tool is for you.

Flag Watcher is licensed under the [GPL-3.0 License](LICENSE).
