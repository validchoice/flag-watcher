# flag watcher 
A simple flag watcher that checks if a specified flag exist.

Flag watcher is only supported for Windows.

## Installation 
Download the [latest version of Flag watcher](https://github.com/validchoice/flag-watcher/releases/latest), and run the installer.

The installer will tells you everything you need to do, that's it! 

If you anti-virus is blocking it, this happens because it's an unknown program, to dismiss it, click on "More info" and click "Run anyway" .

Again, if you don't trust the program, you may check the [source](https://github.com/validchoice/flag-watcher/src/main.rs).

Once installed, flag watcher will be added into your start menu, when you need to check a flag, click on Windows and type in "flag watcher", it will be there! 

## Purpose on making this 
I'm lazy to open Discord and go into a server and use Bloxstrap bot, if you are the same person like me, this is made for you.

Flag watcher is licensed under [GPL-3.0 License](LICENSE)
